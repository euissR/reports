      The EU’s current policies to de-risk critical raw material supply chains
      are moving far too slowly. China dominates the production of the majority
      of the materials that the Commission and European industries deem
      critical. Much is at stake. Defence, medical, green, digital, and other
      vital industries rely on (often indirect) access to these materials.
      Beijing continues to accelerate its weaponisation of these supply chains.
      Its de facto ban on the export of gallium and germanium to the United
      States, Japan and the Netherlands since the summer of 2023 is just one
      example. If geopolitical tensions boil over, European nations are likely
      to find themselves deprived of these essential building blocks for their
      security and prosperity. One conceivable trigger is a military conflict
      over Taiwan.
    </p>
    <p>
      The EUISS brought together 33 key EU stakeholders to formulate additional
      policies that would guarantee supply of three critical materials –
      gallium, germanium and rare earths – as well as their related components,
      even in the case of a complete collapse of relations with China. The goal
      of the workshop: co-design a maximalist policy package that can ‘fully
      de-risk' EU supply chains for these materials by 2030. In our backcasting
      exercise, we defined ‘fully de-risked' as reducing the EU’s (direct and
      indirect) dependence on China for these materials to zero. Instead, EU
      industries would entirely rely on domestic material production and
      supplies from partner countries by 2030. Workshop participants included
      representatives from the European Commission, EU Member States, think
      tanks, research technology organisations, and industry, among which were
      material producers and consumers, including the semiconductor industry
      (see Annex B for the list of participants).
    </p>
    <p>
      What would it take for the EU to achieve this more ambitious goal? We
      invited participants to think outside the box by starting with the end in
      mind. They were asked to score ten EUISS policy options on a scale from 0
      to 10, both in terms of (1) effectiveness in achieving the 2030 goal and
      (2) negative consequences. Participants did this in two surveys, one
      before and one after the four-hour discussion on the content of all policy
      options. What follows is a summary of the group’s views, with a focus on
      the experts’ definitive judgment in the final survey.
    </p>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <!-- chart1 -->
    <div class="container">
      <div class="scroll-content">
        <div class="card" data-step=""></div>
        <div class="card" data-step="1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10">
          <h3>Conclusion 1</h3>
          <p>
            A combination of ‘promote’, ‘protect’, and ‘partner’ measures can
            accomplish a vertically integrated, China-free value chain by 2030 .
            No single policy offers a silver bullet, however. After all, no
            policy is deemed ‘extremely effective’, meaning a 9 or 10 score.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card" data-step="1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10">
          Participants deem nine policies to be ‘net-effective’ (5<) .
        </div>
        <div class="card" data-step="2, 7, 8, 10">
          Only four out of ten policies have ‘high negative consequences’ (5<).
          Participants stress that de-risking measures would need to target the
          entire supply chain. This is a precondition to achieving the 2030
          goal. In addition, participants stress that introducing promote
          policies before protect policies is the best way forward.
        </div>
        <div class="card" data-step="2">
          <h3>Conclusion 2</h3>
          <p>
            Providing various forms of financial support, for example to support
            mining and processing activities (Policy 2), stands out as by far
            the most promising tool to achieve the 2030 goal. After all, Policy
            2 seeks to tackle head-on the main obstacle to greater security of
            supply: China’s predatory pricing. Participants warn that a failure
            to adopt Policy 2 may lead to the EU losing the limited production
            capacity it has at present. However, participants expect it to come
            at a relatively high cost (>5 ).
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card" data-step="1, 5, 6">
          <h3>Conclusion 3</h3>
          <p>
            One ‘no regret’ and two ‘few regrets’ policies should be implemented
            without delay . High effectiveness (8>X>6) and very low negative
            consequences (&lt;3) characterise investment in research,
            innovation, and talent (Policy 5).
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card" data-step="1, 6">
          <p>
            Two ‘few regrets’ options, namely stockpiling (Policy 1) and
            streamlining permitting procedures (Policy 6) are considered to be
            highly effective (>6) with low negative consequences (3&lt;X&lt;4).
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Extensive investment in research, innovation and local and foreign
              talent development (Policy 5) can help the EU and partners
              overcome key (technical) capability gaps. It has one important
              weakness: Policy 5 may not produce results before 2030.
            </li>
            <li>
              Without a more efficient, streamlined permitting process (Policy
              6), the 2030 de-risking goal is almost certainly out of reach.
            </li>
            <li>
              Stockpiling (Policy 1) can protect the EU against immediate
              effects of supply disruptions. This is especially true for
              critical sectors like the defence industry. For them, these
              materials and components are ‘high value, low volume’ commodities.
              Likewise, stockpiling can help generate the demand to kickstart
              production outside of China. Industry and research technology
              organisation representatives have less faith in stockpiling than
              policymakers and think tankers .
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="card" data-step="3, 4, 9">
          <h3>Conclusion 4</h3>
          <p>
            State investment (Policy 3), fiscal overseas support (Policy 4), and
            G7+ economic security standards (Policy 9) offer ‘limited regret’
            options to help strengthen security of supply by 2030. They are
            characterised by high effectiveness (>6) and only moderate negative
            consequences (5>X>4).
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card" data-step="3">
          <p>
            State Investment (Policy 3) can produce a structural business case
            by ensuring investor stability, in the same way that investments by
            JOGMEC provide support on behalf of the Japanese government . Some
            participants deem Policy 3 even more helpful than financial support
            (Policy 2) because they suspect that EU producers would need
            structural support instead of a one-off capital injection. Yet, some
            participants argue that state investment (Policy 3) is expensive and
            potentially wasteful. Others point out that the EU and its Member
            States, unlike the Japanese government, lack the required
            flexibility and expertise.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card" data-step="4">
          <p>
            The participants find that fiscal overseas support (Policy 4) can
            complement policies that seek to promote production inside the EU.
            Many point out that investing in third countries with lower energy
            prices and regulatory burdens will improve the de-risking business
            case. Yet, questions about the future geopolitical position,
            political stability, and Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG)
            checks and balances of these third countries remain.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card" data-step="9">
          <p>
            Introducing G7 and partner economic security standards in public
            procurement (Policy 9) enables EU and partner governments to
            stimulate production in trusted countries. Unlike Policies 2 and 3,
            Policy 9 can achieve this without distorting competition between
            likeminded partners. Important questions remain, such as whether
            Trump 2.0 would consider being a part of a multilateral and slower
            approach. Participants warn of negative consequences: price hikes
            early on, retaliation by China, a loss of EU upstream industry
            competitiveness vis-à-vis likeminded partners, and strained
            relations with non-G7+ countries. Notably, EU Industry and research
            technology organisation representatives express even more doubts and
            a preference for ‘Buy European’ provisions (Policy 7) instead.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card" data-step="7, 10">
          <h3>Conclusion 5</h3>
          <p>
            Buy European’ provisions (Policy 7) and introducing G7 and partner
            tariffs (Policy 10) are two ‘Moderate reward, high price’ policies.
            Participants deem these policies to be net-effective (>5). Yet, both
            come with high negative consequences (>5). They may help contribute
            to reaching the 2030 goal, but only if the EU can introduce them at
            the right time and overcome their potentially severe negative
            consequences.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card" data-step="7">
          <p>
            Buy European’ provisions (Policy 7) may help spur greater material
            production in the EU, but it is unlikely that supply chains can be
            vertically integrated within the EU alone. Participants warn that
            Policy 7 leads to price increases, shortages, reciprocal
            protectionism by partners like the US and Canada, and retaliation by
            China. Industry and research technology organisation representatives
            expect ‘Buy European’ provisions to have few negative consequences.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card" data-step="10">
          <p>
            Participants expect G7 and partner import tariffs (Policy 10) to
            have more downside than upside, especially if introduced in the
            absence of promote measures. Even though these tariffs may protect
            EU and partner industries in the medium-term, it comes at a high
            cost. Policymakers expect Policy 10 to have more severe negative
            consequences, but also to be more effective .
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card" data-step="8">
          <h3>Conclusion 6</h3>
          <p>
            Participants do not consider ESG requirements (Policy 8) an
            effective tool to create greater material security of supply. This
            is the only policy that participants consider as offering ‘No gain.
            Just pain’. After all, Policy 8 stands out with by far the lowest
            expected effectiveness (&lt;4) and the highest negative consequences
            (>6).
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card" data-step="1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10">
          <h3>Conclusion 7</h3>
          <p>
            Some participants propose additional policies. To achieve vertical
            integration, they advocate establishing likeminded industry
            networks, a loosening of state investment rules, and setting up a
            joint G7 and partner development fund to invest in upstream
            industries outside of China. Finally, one participant advocates a
            G7+ stockpile information sharing and management system and to
            control investments from ‘foreign entities of concern’ in upstream
            industries.

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <h3>
      2030 crisis scenario: China imposes a critical raw material export embargo
    </h3>
    <p>
      In early March 2030 the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) finally
      blockades Taiwan. Washington responds, including on the economic front.
      Congress revives the Trading With The Enemy Act and uses it to ban all
      US-China trade. Washington pushes allies to cut off commercial ties to
      China, as well. Losing no time, the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS)
      and the US Treasury introduce sweeping extraterritorial controls and
      sanctions to block all EU semiconductor and other tech-related exports to
      China.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beijing retaliates. Its Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) decrees: No longer
      will critical raw materials, including gallium, germanium, and rare
      earths, or critical components that contain these materials such as wafers
      for semiconductor manufacturing and permanent magnets, be exported to any
      country imposing sanctions or complying with US (extraterritorial)
      sanctions. Beijing pulls the rug from under allied defence industries,
      banning exports of critical materials and components altogether for the
      duration of the conflict. After all, the CCP leadership fears that
      ‘untrusted countries’ will circumvent an otherwise targeted ban.
    </p>
    <p>
      The EU’s current policies to de-risk critical raw material supply chains
      are moving far too slowly. China dominates the production of the majority
      of the materials that the Commission and European industries deem
      critical. Much is at stake. Defence, medical, green, digital, and other
      vital industries rely on (often indirect) access to these materials.
      Beijing continues to accelerate its weaponisation of these supply chains.
      Its de facto ban on the export of gallium and germanium to the United
      States, Japan and the Netherlands since the summer of 2023 is just one
      example. If geopolitical tensions boil over, European nations are likely
      to find themselves deprived of these essential building blocks for their
      security and prosperity. One conceivable trigger is a military conflict
      over Taiwan.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first half of 2025, the EU Institute for Security Studies (EUISS)
      will publish a report on how the EU and partners can ‘fully de-risk'
      gallium, germanium, and rare earth supply chains before 2030. In
      completion of phase 1 of this research project, the EUISS brought together
      33 key EU stakeholders to formulate additional policies that would
      guarantee supply of three critical materials – gallium, germanium and rare
      earths – as well as their related components, even in the case of a
      complete collapse of relations with China .
    </p>
    <p>
      The goal of the workshop: co-design a maximalist policy package that can
      ‘fully de-risk' EU supply chains for these materials by 2030. In our
      backcasting exercise, we defined ‘fully de-risked' as reducing the EU’s
      (direct and indirect) dependence on China for these materials to zero.
      Instead, by 2030 EU industries would entirely rely on domestic production
      and supplies from a diverse mix of partner countries, such as Canada and
      the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Workshop participants include
      representatives from the European Commission, EU Member States, think
      tanks, research technology organisations, and industry, among whom
      material producers and consumers, including the semiconductor industry
      (see Annex B for the list of participants).
    </p>

    <button class="collapsible">
      <span class="tag"></span>
      Why focus on gallium, germanium, rare earths?
    </button>
    <div class="content">
      <div class="content-inner">
        <p>
          We selected gallium, germanium, and rare earths and related
          components, such as semiconductor wafers and permanent magnets, based
          on the following criteria:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>China dominates their production</li>
          <li>
            China is already weaponising these supply chains and is laying the
            groundwork for further action in the future;
          </li>
          <li>
            The EU’s security and prosperity already today depend on access to
            these critical materials and components derived from them;
          </li>
          <li>
            The EU and partner countries at present have industries that (often
            indirectly) make use of these materials.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Take point 3: Gallium is used to produce semiconductors (wafers),
          LED-lighting, and photovoltaics. Optical fibres, infrared optics and
          satellite solar cells contain germanium. Rare earths are used to
          produce permanent magnets, among a range of other products. In turn,
          these components are vital for current EU and partner downstream
          industries to produce essential goods. Defence, space, medical,
          telecommunications, (wind) energy, and other critical sectors are
          notably dependent on these components and therefore indirectly on
          these materials.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gallium, germanium, and rare earths (indirectly) are all used in vital
          end-use industries in the EU or partner countries at present (point
          4). Therefore, vertically integrating upstream supply chains can in
          fact help improve EU security of supply. On the contrary, expanding
          material security of supply for critical products that are at present
          not produced in the EU or partner states at scale requires additional
          action. For example, expanding production of cobalt for batteries in
          the EU or in partner countries is unlikely to enhance EV security of
          supply (at least in the short term). After all, battery producers are
          still mostly based in China. Gallium, germanium, and rare earths and
          related components, namely semiconductor wafers and permanent magnets,
          on the other hand are all used by vital end-industries in the EU or
          partner countries at present. Even though this workshop focused only
          on how to de-risk supply chains for these three metals, many outcomes
          apply to a broader range of China-dominated materials.
        </p>

    <p>
      What would it take for the EU to achieve this more ambitious goal? We
      invited participants to think outside the box, by starting with the end in
      mind. They were asked to score ten EUISS policy options on a scale from 0
      to 10, in terms of two criteria: (1) effectiveness in achieving the 2030
      goal and (2) severity of negative consequences. In addition to ranking the
      options, many participants made use of the opportunity to provide detailed
      written comments on what negative consequences each policy option may
      have. Participants did this in two surveys, one before and one after the
      four-hour discussion on the content of all policy options. What follows is
      a summary of the group’s views, with a focus on the experts’ definitive
      judgment in the final survey. Please see Table 1 for an overview, and this
      attachment for a full description of each policy option.

      Intra-EU Delphi workshop methodology (Afternoon, 9 December 2024)
    </button>
    <div class="content">
      <div class="content-inner">
        <p>
          EUISS asked participants to score ten EUISS policy options on a scale
          from 0 to 10 during a Delphi workshop, both in terms of their (1)
          effectiveness in making the 2030 goal a reality and (2) negative
          consequences. In addition, participants made use of the option to
          specify negative consequences of each policy option in detailed
          written comments.
        </p>
        <p>
          Participants did this in two identical surveys, one before and one
          after the four-hour discussion on the content of all policy options.
          Participants filled out the pre-event survey after reading an EUISS
          discussion paper. This included background information on the current
          gallium, germanium, and rare earth production chain, a snapshot of
          what a friend-shored supply chain in 2030 may look like, a crisis
          scenario, and a detailed description of EUISS policy options (see
          textbox 1 for the scenario and find the full discussion paper in this
          attachment).
        </p>
        <p>
          At the start of the workshop, we presented the outcomes of the
          pre-event survey. This was followed by an EUISS-moderated four-hour
          discussion on the effectiveness and negative consequences of each
          policy option, including on how each policy could be improved. At the
          close of the event, participants offered their definitive judgment on
          the policy package in a post-event survey.
        </p>
        <p>
          24 out of the total 34 workshop participants filled out the pre-event
          survey, within the submission period (9:45am 29 November to 4:00pm 6
          December 2024). We received two late submissions. These last responses
          were not incorporated in the pre-event survey results, nor in the
          EUISS presentation during the workshop. However, we will leverage
          these insights, particularly the qualitative responses, in the final
          EUISS report.
        </p>
        <p>
          27 participants filled out the post-event survey, of whom 20 had also
          filled out the pre-event survey. To make answers comparable across
          surveys, the below presentation on the post-event survey outcomes only
          takes into account the post-event survey responses of those that
          filled out both surveys. The EUISS will still leverage the remaining
          seven responses, particularly the qualitative answers provided, in the
          completion of the final report. The respondents mostly (20 out of 27)
          filled out the post-event survey directly at the end of the event (9
          December between 5:00 and 5:40pm), six within four days, and one only
          on 25 December.

    <h2>Workshop outcomes</h2>
    <h3>Conclusion 1</h3>
    <p>
      A combination of promote, protect, and partner measures can accomplish a
      vertically integrated, China-free value chain by 2030. No single policy
      offers a silver bullet, however. After all, no policy is deemed ‘extremely
      effective’, meaning a 9 or 10 score. Participants deem nine policies to be
      ‘net-effective’ (5&lt;). Only four out of ten policies have ‘high negative
      consequences’ (5&lt;). Participants stress that de-risking measures would
      need to target the entire supply chain. This is a precondition to
      achieving the 2030 goal. In addition, participants stress that introducing
      promote policies first is the best way forward.
    </p>
    <div class=".chart .halfchart" id="chart3" data-chart-id="3"></div>
    <p>
      Achieving security of supply requires vertically integrating industries,
      all the way from the current point of direct dependence on China to the
      extraction of raw materials. Participants note that reshoring or
      friend-shoring just one or several production steps in the value chain
      does not actually secure supply. This kind of scattered de-risking
      approach simply creates a new critical economic input for which the EU
      directly relies on China. For example, in addition to dominating permanent
      magnet production, approximately 90% of all rare earth refining takes
      place in China. Even if the EU on-shores permanent magnet-making, Beijing
      could still (threaten to) weaponise the supply of materials needed to
      produce these components. Therefore, securing supply requires that EU and
      partner industries move their entire supply chain outside of China.
    </p>
    <p>
      Introducing measures in the correct order and at the right time is of the
      upmost importance. Many participants advocate first generating supply
      outside of China (promote), and only then shielding EU markets (protect)
      from China’s power trade tactics, such as its flooding of the market with
      below market-price products and its weaponisation of supply. Both promote
      and protect measures should be coordinated with partners (partner). If
      production does not yet take place outside of China at scale but the EU
      and its partners already disincentivise supply from China, steep price
      increases, and perhaps even shortages, may occur. This is especially true
      in today’s constrained gallium and germanium markets. China has already
      capped the exports of these materials. Even worse, China could aggravate
      shortages caused by a protect-first-promote-later strategy by retaliating
      early, for instance by artificially cutting off supply to the EU.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conversely, if the EU introduces promote measures first, but does not
      adopt protect measures soon after, then Beijing is in a strong position to
      undercut vulnerable competitors. China could simply flood the market with
      cheap components and materials to put EU and partner production out of
      business. In short, participants find that promote measures should
      kickstart EU and partner production. Protect measures ought to follow soon
      after to ensure the longer-term financial viability of EU and partner
      producers.
    </p>

    <h3>Conclusion 2</h3>
    <p>
      Providing various forms of financial support, for example to support
      mining and processing activities (Policy 2), stands out as by far the most
      promising tool to achieve a China-free value chain by 2030. After all,
      Policy 2 seeks to tackle head-on the main obstacle to greater
      self-sufficiency: China’s predatory pricing. However, participants expect
      it to come at a relatively high cost (>5).
    </p>
    <p>
      Several participants argue that introducing financial support tools
      (Policy 2) is necessary for EU material producers to ‘just’ maintain their
      current production capacity. Energy-intensive industries in the EU face
      financial challenges, because of Russia’s gas blackmail and decisions by
      EU governments to reduce domestic energy production. Ruling out financial
      support may undermine more than a few business cases. Even worse, the EU
      may even lose the limited production capacity it has at present.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other participants voice concern about the high costs of the policy, since
      creating greater security of supply requires moving not one, but a whole
      range of upstream (e.g., mining, refining, component-making) industries
      out of China. This would put more pressure on already strained government
      budgets throughout the EU, perhaps even contributing to inflation. In
      addition, mining and refining industries compete for public de-risking
      funding with other critical industries, such as the pharmaceutical and
      semiconductor industries. Participants also warn of the risk of investing
      in companies that have not proven themselves in the marketplace. Others
      express concerns that a loosening of state aid rules would make the
      playing field in the EU more uneven.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, some participants fear that financial support may spark subsidy
      races with partner countries. Partners also encourage and incentivise
      their industries to move material supply chains out of China. Many of
      these partners, including the US, Canada, Australia, and Japan, are better
      equipped to expand material production at various stages of the supply
      chain. For one, the first three have lower energy costs, a lower
      population density, and less stringent environmental regulations.
    </p>

    <h3>Conclusion 3</h3>
    <p>
      One ‘no regret’ and two ‘few regrets’ policies should be implemented
      without delay. High effectiveness (8>X>6) and very low negative
      consequences (<3) characterise investment in research, innovation, and
      talent (Policy 5.). Two ‘few regrets’ options, namely stockpiling (Policy
      1.) and streamlining permitting (Policy 6.) are considered to be highly
      effective (>6) with low negative consequences (3<X<4).
    </p>
    <p>
      Extensive investment in research, innovation and local and foreign talent
      development (Policy 5) can help the EU and partners overcome key
      (technical) capability gaps. It has one important weakness: Policy 5 may
      not produce results before 2030 . Investment in innovation, domestic
      talent development and attracting foreign talent can help the EU and
      partners overcome important technical obstacles to de-risking material
      value chains. Importantly, technological breakthroughs can strengthen the
      ability of EU industries to efficiently extract gallium and germanium from
      zinc concentrates. These investments can also have positive spillovers
      into other domains.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, many innovation and training efforts will materialise after the 2030
      target, especially if these investments do not focus on projects with a
      relatively high technical readiness level (TRL). The skilled workforce
      shortage in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM)
      plagues many industries. Solving it through domestic talent development is
      an important, but longer-term project. Attracting foreign talent is an
      effective alternative that may produce results sooner. However, this may
      prove difficult in industries, like mining and refining, in which the EU’s
      current global standing is limited. Relying on foreign talent may also go
      hand-in-hand with (unwanted) technology transfer, including to China.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without a more efficient, streamlined permitting process (Policy 6), the
      2030 de-risking goal is almost certainly out of reach. Even though
      participants overall judge negative consequences to be limited, some
      stress that expediting the permitting process may lead to environmental
      pollution and aggravate health-related risks. Consultation processes for
      local populations will have to be shorter too. This may lead to greater
      societal resistance, as industries like mining remain unpopular in Europe.
      Politicians, industry leaders, and experts could address these concerns by
      stressing the ‘overriding public interest’ of these projects, especially
      as Europe’s security situation deteriorates rapidly .
    </p>
    <p>
      Stockpiling (Policy 1) can protect the EU against immediate effects of
      supply disruptions. This is especially true for critical sectors like the
      defence industry. For them, these materials and components are ‘high
      value, low volume’ commodities. Likewise, stockpiling can help kickstart
      production outside of China. Industry representatives have less faith in
      stockpiling than policymakers and think tankers.
    </p>
    <p>
      For ‘high value, low volume’ commodities, stockpiling may even be a
      medium-term solution, provided that these materials are not subject to
      corrosion. So far, Japan and the United States appear to have succeeded in
      dealing with China’s de facto export boycott of gallium and germanium,
      partially by relying on (private) stockpiles. The volumes are key. Demand
      for rare earth permanent magnets for wind turbines reaches several hundred
      thousand tons in France alone. Stockpiling at this scale would likely be
      expensive. In these situations, the business case for upstream industries
      to stockpile may be weak, without fiscal support or a price floor for
      upstream producers. At the other extreme, participants note that the
      production of European semiconductor manufacturers only relies on several
      hundred kilograms of an ultra-pure gallium derivative per year.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, it is important to note the limits of Policy 1’s effectiveness.
      Stockpiling buys EU industries time but does not solve upstream
      dependencies on China in the absence of other policies. In the end, a
      stockpile of an ultra-pure gallium derivative will have to be replenished,
      which at present requires access to China-produced unwrought gallium.
      Filling the stockpile may still contribute to vertically integrating value
      chains, however. The stockpiling authority can serve as a stable buyer of
      materials produced outside of China, for example through guaranteed
      offtake from EU and partner industries at a minimum price.
    </p>
    <p>
      The participants identify key challenges to making stockpiling a success.
      These are: identifying the right item to stockpile (meaning the current
      direct dependency on China) in close coordination with industry; the
      limited shelf-life of some material derivatives; the short-term risk of
      driving up prices (or perhaps even depriving EU industry) of materials
      especially in already (geopolitically) constrained gallium and germanium
      markets; retaliation by China; selecting industries that have priority
      access to the stockpile; establishing a competent authority that manages
      the inflow and outflow of the stock; ensuring that stockpiling obligations
      for private (up-, mid-, and downstream) companies do not endanger their
      competitiveness globally; and creating a business case for storage
      companies, especially in markets where demand for materials and components
      is low.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider the first challenge: identifying the right material to stockpile
      for an extended period. Direct dependencies on China are not fixed. For
      example, the EU still relies on China-supplied gallium today to produce
      gallium wafers, which are used to produce semiconductors. But China is
      rapidly expanding its domestic production of wafers. If China’s
      overproduction of wafers crowds out EU production in the future, then EU
      industry may come to rely on China for this key component. This would make
      a stockpile of gallium derivatives to produce wafers pointless, as the
      dependency has moved downstream. In short, carefully identifying the item
      that should be stockpiled and continuously monitoring changes in the
      supply chain is necessary for a successful stockpiling policy (Policy 1).
    </p>

    <h3>Conclusion 4</h3>
    <p>
      State investment (Policy 3), fiscal overseas support (Policy 4), and G7+
      economic security standards (Policy 9) offer ‘limited regret’ options to
      help strengthen security of supply by 2030. They are characterised by high
      effectiveness (>6) and only moderate negative consequences (5>X>4).
    </p>
    <p>
      State Investment (Policy 3) can produce a structural business case by
      ensuring investor stability, in the same way that JOGMEC contributes on
      behalf of the Japanese government . Some participants deem Policy 3 even
      more helpful than financial support (Policy 2) because they suspect that
      EU producers would need structural support instead of a one-off capital
      injection. Yet, some participants argue that state investment (Policy 3)
      is expensive and potentially wasteful. Others point out that the EU and
      its Member States, unlike the Japanese government, lack the required
      flexibility and expertise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Participants note that state investment (Policy 3) comes with many of the
      same risks as other financial support tools, but also additional ones.
      Like financial support (Policy 2), state investment runs the risk of
      investing in companies that have not proven themselves in the marketplace.
      The EU and partners would pick winners rather than create a China-proof,
      level-playing field (for example through tax benefits for upstream
      producers) for EU and non-EU industrial players. Similarly, several
      participants warn that direct state investment puts pressure on EU and
      Member State budgets and may even lead to subsidy races between likeminded
      countries.
    </p>
    <p>
      The participants also foresee negative consequences specific to state
      investment (Policy 3). Participants argue that EU institutions and Member
      State governments lack the technical expertise and industry insight to
      play a constructive role as a ‘golden shareholder’. Some participants fear
      that the decision-making processes of institutions behind a European
      version of JOGMEC, the Japan Organization for Metals and Energy Security,
      would be too slow to respond to Chinese counteractions, given the many
      levels at which decisions are taken in the EU.
    </p>
    <p>
      The participants find that fiscal overseas support (Policy 4) can
      complement policies that seek to promote production inside the EU. Many
      point out that investing in third countries with lower energy prices and
      regulatory burdens will improve the de-risking business case. Yet,
      questions about the future geopolitical alignment, political stability,
      and Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) checks and balances of
      third countries remain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost all the EU’s partners, from Canada to the Democratic Republic of
      the Congo (DRC), impose less stringent environmental regulations, fewer
      reporting obligations, and shorter consultation processes on industries.
      Many partners face far lower energy costs than the EU. Furthermore,
      likeminded countries, such as Canada and Australia, are developing their
      own policies to stimulate material production. Fiscal overseas support
      (Policy 4) can make use of synergies with these projects to help achieve
      the 2030 goal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, some participants warn that moving production from China to other
      third countries gives the EU less control. As great power tensions
      increase, Washington and Beijing will push more countries to take sides.
      Today’s nonaligned countries, like Malaysia or the DRC, may in the future
      no longer be as welcoming to cooperation with EU industry. If a conflict
      over Taiwan breaks out, for instance, many countries will be forced to
      take sides. This may result in the loss of EU investments in third
      countries, and perhaps even of industrial expertise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there are other events that may endanger EU-sponsored investments.
      Countries with weaker governance, for example the DRC, may face political
      instability, or even civil war, putting investments at risk. Resource
      nationalism is on the rise around the world, with more countries resorting
      to trade restrictions for materials. For example, Indonesia has banned the
      export of unwrought nickel. In an extreme case, a third-country government
      may nationalise EU-supported projects if they perceive the benefits of
      these project to be insufficient. Finally, the EU and its Member States
      have fewer tools to ensure ethical conduct in the projects in which they
      invest abroad. As a result, EU-supported projects risk becoming mired in
      scandals. This is especially true in countries where environmental and
      human rights regulations are lax.
    </p>
    <p>
      Introducing G7 and partner economic security standards in public
      procurement (Policy 9) enables EU and partner governments to stimulate
      production in trusted countries. Unlike Policies 2 and 3, Policy 9 can
      achieve this without distorting competition between likeminded partners.
      Important questions remain, such as whether Trump 2.0 would consider a
      multilateral and slower approach. Participants warn of negative
      consequences: price hikes early on, retaliation by China, a loss of EU
      upstream industry competitiveness vis-à-vis likeminded partners, and
      strained relations with non-G7+ countries. Notably, EU industry
      representatives express even more doubts and a preference for ‘Buy
      European’ provisions (Policy 7) instead.
    </p>
    <p>
      EU and Member State public procurement processes are powerful tools to
      incentivise greater production outside of China. Public institutions can
      require that firms which aspire to execute public projects use components
      and materials produced by reliable partners. For example, governments
      investing in offshore wind can set the requirements to which wind turbine
      manufacturers should adhere. EU governments can therefore include clauses
      that guarantee offtake of strategic products manufactured by EU and
      partner industries. Governments can, for instance, demand that downstream
      industries use minimum shares of components, such as permanent magnets,
      and materials, for example rare earths, produced in G7+ countries. At the
      same time, Policy 9 heavily penalises the reliance on products from
      foreign entities of concern, including China. The G7 and key partners
      together make up over 60% of global GDP. This produces scale.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, participants also outline limits to Policy 9’s
      effectiveness. The United States is a well-placed player to onshore
      materials production. Some expect Trump 2.0 to pursue a unilateral
      industrial policy, heavily focused on achieving immediate results. From
      the US perspective, G7 and partner negotiations on common standards will
      likely be too slow. After all, China already halted germanium and gallium
      exports to the US in 2023. Others warn that Policy 9, while helpful,
      misses the mark. After all, consumer markets, not public procurement,
      generate most of the demand for components and materials.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, participants outline possible negative consequences. First,
      if the EU and partners introduce Policy 9 before sufficient supply outside
      of China comes online, prices for related materials and components may
      increase quickly. Products may even become scarce. Second, designating
      China, Russia and others as ‘foreign entities of concern’ may lead Beijing
      to retaliate sooner. After all, China’s leadership may become convinced
      that its material leverage over others will decrease over time. Third, the
      United States, Canada and Australia may outcompete EU producers at
      multiple stages of the value chain because of lower energy prices, more
      mineral deposits, and looser environmental regulations. Finally,
      spearheading G7 and partner economic security standards (Policy 9) may
      lead to disillusionment in third countries, such as India, even when they
      are invited to join the public procurement regime. After all, these
      countries would be rule-takers rather than rule-makers.
    </p>

    <h3>Conclusion 5</h3>
    <p>
      ‘Buy European’ provisions (Policy 7) and introducing G7 and partner
      tariffs (Policy 10) are two ‘Moderate reward, high price’ policies.
      Participants deem these policies to be net-effective (>5). Yet, both come
      with high negative consequences (>5). They may help contribute to reaching
      the 2030 goal, but only if the EU can introduce them at the right time and
      overcome their potentially severe negative consequences.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Buy European’ provisions (Policy 7) may help spur greater material
      production in the EU, but it is unlikely that supply chains can be
      vertically integrated within the EU alone. Participants warn that Policy
      10 leads to price increases, shortages, reciprocal protectionism by
      partners like the US and Canada, and retaliation by China. Industry
      representatives expect ‘Buy European’ provisions to have few negative
      consequences.
    </p>
    <p>
      The EU at present does not have the required industries to reproduce the
      entire gallium, germanium, and rare earth supply chains that China
      currently dominates. As a result, ‘Buy European’ provisions (Policy 7) in
      public procurement and for private companies are likely to lead to higher
      prices for businesses and consumers (even more so than Policy 9). It may
      even lead to shortages, including in critical sectors such as defence
      industries. This is especially true if the policy is not preceded by
      promote policies for EU industries. Some participants warned that
      downstream companies in the EU will face higher costs, perhaps even
      impeding their ability to compete globally. This is especially true in
      highly competitive global markets such as semiconductor manufacturing. EU
      industry already faces high costs, due to labour and energy prices in the
      EU, as well as stringent environmental regulations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Key partners and rivals are also unlikely to respond positively to ‘Buy
      European’ provisions (Policy 7). The UK, US, Norway, Canada, Japan and
      Australia are all seeking a way out of overdependence on China.
      ‘Buy-European’ provisions may lead them to implement or expand similar
      policies. This could asymmetrically damage the EU’s interests. After all,
      many of these countries are better positioned to produce materials,
      especially at the mining stage. One participant argues that in an extreme
      case partners may close their markets to EU-components and materials
      altogether. Finally, China may retaliate because of the exclusion of its
      below-market-price products.
    </p>
    <p>
      Participants expect G7 and partner import tariffs (Policy 10) to have more
      downsides than benefits, especially if introduced in the absence of
      promote measures. Even though these tariffs may protect EU and partner
      industries in the medium term, it comes at a high cost. Policymakers
      expect Policy 10 to have more severe negative consequences, but also to be
      more effective.
    </p>
    <p>
      Key challenges are identifying the right material or component on which to
      impose tariffs and dealing with higher prices for materials and
      components, especially in the short term. In turn, this would lead to
      reduced competitiveness of EU mid- and downstream industries. These
      effects would be especially severe if G7+ governments adopt Policy 10
      before sufficient supply outside of China has come online. Other risks are
      a backlash from nonaligned countries left out of the zero-tariff trade
      regime, and retaliation and tariff circumvention by countries of concern,
      including by China.
    </p>

    <h3>Conclusion 6</h3>
    <p>
      Participants do not consider ESG requirements (Policy 8) an effective tool
      to create greater material security of supply. This is the only policy
      that participants consider as offering ‘No gain. Just pain’. After all,
      Policy 8 stands out with by far the lowest expected effectiveness (<4) and
      the highest negative consequences (>6).
    </p>
    <p>
      Effectiveness is low because participants expect that Chinese producers
      will likely be able to (whether in practice or on paper) live up to ESG
      requirements, whereas many other developing nations will not.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same time, some participants expect ESG requirements to come with
      severe negative consequences. These include inflationary pressures and
      potentially even shortages, a weakening of the competitiveness of EU
      upstream industries in global markets, disengagement of EU companies from
      emerging markets (‘cut and run’ instead of ‘stay and behave’ behaviour),
      limiting EU industry capacity for actual investments because of reporting
      requirements, industry leaving the EU for destinations with fewer
      reporting requirements (for example the US and Canada), and growing
      alienation of Global South countries because of perceived unfair trade
      restrictions for their products. One participant mentions that both the
      corporate sustainability due diligence directive (CSDDD) and the carbon
      border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) pose hurdles for EU industry to expand
      material production, while the positive ESG-impact of these policies
      remains questionable.
    </p>

    <h3>Conclusion 7</h3>
    <p>
      Some participants propose additional policies. To achieve vertical
      integration, they advocate establishing likeminded industry networks, a
      loosening of state investment rules, and setting up a joint G7 and partner
      development fund to invest in upstream industries outside of China.
      Finally, one participant advocates a G7+ stockpile information sharing and
      management system and to control investments from ‘foreign entities of
      concern’ in upstream industries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Participants propose promote, protect and partner policies of their own.
      On promote and partner, the EU and partners should seek to establish joint
      downstream, midstream, and upstream industry networks, to ensure that
      vertical integration can take place outside of China. Current policy
      initiatives, like the European Chips Act, fail to take into account the
      entire value chain including the production of semiconductor materials.
      Furthermore, participants argue that the EU and partners should loosen
      state aid rules to invest in ‘cross-industry supply chain resilience
      platforms’ or in specific strategic companies. Some participants advocate
      setting up a joint development fund with G7+ partners, to invest in
      ‘multiple mining and refining companies’ outside of foreign entities of
      concern. The EU would be a co-investor in these efforts.
    </p>
    <p>
      On protect and partner policies, some propose to establish a ‘G7+
      stockpile management platform’. participants argue in favour of
      governments and strategic industries sharing information on the stock
      levels for various materials, streamlining the process to procure
      components and materials from likeminded partners, and helping to
      coordinate the release of stock in times of crises. In addition, ‘FDI and
      ownership of stocks’ in EU and partner upstream industries should be
      carefully controlled.

      Annex A: Pre-workshop and post-workshop survey ‘between group’ outcome
      differences
    </h3>
    <p>
      Throughout the workshop, industry & research and technology organisations,
      think tankers and consultancies, and policymakers, reached far greater
      consensus. The pre-workshop survey shows far greater differences between
      groups than the post-workshop survey.

        <div class="card" data-step="3, 4, 8">
          <p>
            Industry, think tankers, and policymakers found common ground on
            state investment (Policy 3), fiscal overseas support (Policy 4), and
            ESG requirements (Policy 8). On four policies, opinions remain
            divided.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card" data-step="7, 9, 10">
          <p>
            In the pre-workshop survey, the groups still had significant
            disagreements on either the effectiveness or the negative
            consequences of seven out of the ten policies . In the closing
            survey, only four such disagreements remained. Differences of
            opinion on the negative consequences and effectiveness of G7+
            economic security standards in public procurement (Policy 9) and G7+
            import tariffs (Policy 10) remain but have become considerably
            smaller. Industry and RTOs, unlike the other groups, continue to
            believe that the negative consequences of ‘Buy European’ (Policy 7)
            provisions are limited.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card" data-step="4, 8">
          <p>
            Before the workshop, the groups still disagreed substantially on the
            effectiveness and negative consequences of fiscal overseas support
            (Policy 4) and ESG requirements (Policy 8). Policymakers warned that
            fiscal overseas support would have severe negative consequences
            (=7), while industry doubted the measure’s effectiveness (6>). In
            the pre-workshop survey, policymakers had highlighted ESG
            requirements as a no regret option with a high effectiveness (6&lt;)
            and limited negative consequences (&lt;4). Industry and RTOs, on the
            other hand, had designated this policy as ‘No gain. Just gain’ from
            the start. After the workshop, both groups deemed this policy both
            ineffective and counterproductive to the security of supply goal.
